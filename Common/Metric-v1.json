            "description": "This Metric Address field together with the Metric Path field uniquely identifies how to access a specific metric value from a device. The structure of this field (and of the Metric Path field) is determined by the protocol being used: 1) Fieldbus: Database memory address given as %aa####.* where aa is replaced by letters which determine the type of variable (eg. boolean input I and output Q, byte IB and QB, word IW and QW, and double word ID and QD). #### is replaced by digits representing the byte number of the metric and * by a digit representing the bit number. 2) REST: Path following the domain in a REST call URL. If using REST to access data from MiR AGVs, the data will be returned in JSON format. One complication here is that recursive function calls may be required to obtain the required data. For example, to obtain whether a robot is 'active' or not, you need to first run the GET /robots command to return a list of robots together with URLs that will provide more data for each robot. Then, using the URLs, another command of the form GET /robots/robot_id needs to be requested and this will return a more detailed JSON response where one of the metrics will be the 'active' status. So the active status of a robot first requires the output from another request for the list of robot URLs. In such cases, the notation to use is of the form <PathToList,IdentifiersJsonPath>, where PathToList should be replaced by the REST endpoint to the list of items (in our example /robots) and IdentifiersJsonPath should use JSONPath notation (for more information see the Metric Path Section below) for a list of all identifiers ($..url). The translation app will then cache the data available from each robot's URL in the list of robots and return the available variables for each (one of which is the 'active' status ). 3) MTConnect: This also uses REST as the protocol but will return a response in the form of XML rather than JSON. Again we must specify the path following the domain in a REST call URL and most of the live data for MTConnect devices can be accessed using /current . 4) OpenProtocol (SmartTools): The OpenProtocol MID number and the revision of the MID in the form mid****rev### where **** is replaced by the 4 digits representing the MID of the message and ### is replaced by the 3 digits representing the revision of the MID. 5) Other: TBD",

If the returned value is in JSON format, JSONPath notation should be used to uniquely identify the metric. The JSONPath starts with a $ and each child element is separated by a '.'. For the XML format and there is a standard notation to query XML data called XPath (analogous to JSONPath). The notation recommended here is to use the select all operator //* and then identify a specific metric by searching for a specific attribute name [@attributeName=\"test\"]. To obtain the text content (actual data values) of an XML node, we can use /text() at the end of the attribute query. In some cases (such as MTConnect Conditions) it may be required to obtain the name of the XML node (eg. Normal, Warning or Fault for an MTConnect Condition) itself rather than just the text associated with the node. Here, we must use local-name() and place the attribute query within the parenthesis. Note: appending /local-name() to the end of the attribute query will not work. Leave blank for protocols where the value is returned plain.",
