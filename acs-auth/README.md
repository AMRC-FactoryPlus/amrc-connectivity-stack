# ACS Authorisation Service

> The [AMRC Connectivity Stack (ACS)](https://github.com/AMRC-FactoryPlus/amrc-connectivity-stack) is an open-source implementation of the AMRC's [Factory+ Framework](https://factoryplus.app.amrc.co.uk).

This `acs-auth` service satisfies the **Authorisation** component of the Factory+ framework and provides authorisation services to other Factory+ services. It provides a framework allowing unified treatment of ACL information, with all permissions editing in one place.

For more information about the Authorisation component of Factory+ see the [specification](https://factoryplus.app.amrc.co.uk) or for an example of how to deploy this service see the [AMRC Connectivity Stack repository](https://github.com/AMRC-FactoryPlus/amrc-connectivity-stack).
