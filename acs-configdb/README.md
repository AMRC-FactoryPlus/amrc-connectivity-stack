# ACS ConfigDB Service

> The [AMRC Connectivity Stack (ACS)](https://github.com/AMRC-FactoryPlus/amrc-connectivity-stack) is an open-source implementation of the AMRC's [Factory+ Framework](https://factoryplus.app.amrc.co.uk).

This `acs-configdb` service satisfies the **Config Store** component of the Factory+ framework and provides a place for applications consuming Factory+ data to store configuration relating to Factory+ entities. It allows configuration to be centrally managed, and allows generic configuration to be shared between applications.

For more information about the Config Store component of Factory+ see the [specification](https://factoryplus.app.amrc.co.uk) or for an example of how to deploy this service see the [AMRC Connectivity Stack repository](https://github.com/AMRC-FactoryPlus/amrc-connectivity-stack).
