# ACS Identity Service

> The [AMRC Connectivity Stack (ACS)](https://github.com/AMRC-FactoryPlus/amrc-connectivity-stack) is an open-source implementation of the AMRC's [Factory+ Framework](https://factoryplus.app.amrc.co.uk).

This `acs-identity` service satisfies the **Identity** component of the Factory+ framework and provides a Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) to centralise identity management.

For more information about the Identity component of Factory+ see the [specification](https://factoryplus.app.amrc.co.uk) or for an example of how to deploy this service see the [AMRC Connectivity Stack repository](https://github.com/AMRC-FactoryPlus/amrc-connectivity-stack).
