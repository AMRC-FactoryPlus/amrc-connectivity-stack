                                        The kind of principal to create. Random is a fully random key which
                                        will be recorded as a keytab in the keytabs secret. Password generates
                                        a random (machine) password and records it in the passwords secret.
                                        PresetPassword expects a password to have already been recorded in the
                                        passwords secret; this password will be used as-is. HumanPassword
                                        generates a password for a human user.

                                        secret will be located in the same namespace as this object.

                                        Defaults to the secret configured in the operator for
                                        keytabs or passwords and the name of this object as key.
                                        This default should be considered deprecated, and will only
                                        be applied for objects in the operator's default namespace
                                        where the default secrets are.

                                        should contain a PEM-encoded X.509 certificate to sign to.
                                        This will create a SealedSecret object rather than a Secret.
                                        The ConfigMap needs to be in the same namespace as this
