# InfluxDB Sparkplug Historian

A component that allows InfluxDB to function as a comprehensive Sparkplug-based data historian. It was developed for the [AMRC Connectiviy Stack](https://github.com/AMRC-FactoryPlus/amrc-connectivity-stack), the AMRC's open-source implementation of the Factory+ framework.

See the [ACS Helm chart](https://github.com/AMRC-FactoryPlus/amrc-connectivity-stack) for information on how to deploy this component.
