Thanks for installing the AMRC Connectivity Stack (ACS), the AMRC's open-source implementation of the Factory+ framework.

Ensure that you familiarise yourself with the components and concepts of Factory+ (factoryplus.app.amrc.co.uk) before continuing. This chart installs a full end-to-end deployment of Factory+ and there are a lot of moving parts.

⚠️ Next Steps
-------------

This Chart creates a load balancer on your Kubernetes cluster that exposes all services at the subdomains listed below. If your cluster does not support LoadBalancer ingress types then you may port-forward specific services but you may need to update ConfigMap entries to point to the forwarded ports instead of using the FQDN.

You specified {{.Values.acs.baseUrl}} as your base URL. Please ensure that you have a wildcard DNS entry configured to direct all *.{{.Values.acs.baseUrl}} requests to the load balancer.

{{ if .Values.acs.secure}}
🔒 Because secure mode is enabled, you need to ensure that your cluster has a wildcard TLS certificate (type: kubernetes.io/tls) called {{.Values.acs.tlsSecretName}} in the "default" namespace on your cluster. It must have a certificate value in the `tls.crt` key and the private key value in the `tls.key` key.
{{end}}

🚀 Get Started
-------------

Once the services have been deployed, get the password for the admin user by running:

echo $(sudo kubectl get secret krb5-passwords -o jsonpath="{.data.admin}" -n {{.Release.Namespace}} | base64 --decode)

! Once you have the MQTT password for the admin user you can log into the manager. Head over to {{ .Values.acs.secure | ternary "https://" "http://" }}manager.{{.Values.acs.baseUrl}} and login as the `admin` user.

Services
--------
Manager: {{ .Values.acs.secure | ternary "https://" "http://" }}manager.{{.Values.acs.baseUrl}}
MQTT: {{ .Values.acs.secure | ternary "mqtts://" "mqtt://" }}mqtt.{{.Values.acs.baseUrl}}:8883
